; * There is not much of a calling convention used in this set of demos because
;   the individual demos are fairly simple and do not nest complex functionality
;   in a way that would warrant policing registers beyond about r8. The lifetime
;   of the values stored in higher registers is usually the entire demo, or a
;   non-nested subsection of the demo.
; * Thus, r1 through r8 are considered callee-saved, r9 through r29 are
;   unspecified, r30 is used as the stack pointer, and r31 as the link register.
; * Plain zero-terminated strings are used throughout the demos, which are just
;   sequences of one (mostly) ASCII character per cell, terminated with a 0
;   cell. Only the 16 LSB matter, which allows encoding the entire string,
;   including the terminating zero, with dw.
; * Some comments also refer to "terminal format" when describing values. For
;   the meaning behind this, consult the R3 manual.
